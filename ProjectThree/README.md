# Project 3 - RideForce

RideForce, previously RideShare, is a ride coordinating application for Revature Associates. All associates can create an account on the first day of training with a temporary access token generated by the app upon request of the trainer. A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. Any associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have registered cars based on proximity and preference.

# Progress Update

We were the third iteration of RideForce. As our main job was to convert the application to a PWA, it is important to mention that performance was not a priority for the first two iterations. Using Lighthouse, which is an automated tool for improving the quality of web applications, the initial audit of RideForce displayed a zero for performance (on a scale up to one hundred). A picture of the initial audit can be seen below.

All of the key performance metrics like "First Contentful Paint" and "Time to Interactive" were around forty seconds which is far from the standard for a PWA. Therefore, the site received a zero for performance and due to a deep link routing issue, a question mark for PWA. The majority of our time was spent converting the application to a PWA and optimizing the performance. The final audit, which can be done at https://d38jr4rxg3oec5.cloudfront.net/ is shown below.

The application now earned a sixty-two for performance and a ninety-two for PWA. We utilized numerous techniques to enhance the performance including minimization, text compression, converting images into next-gen formats and pre-loading and deferring specific resources. On top of this, we had to perform an overhaul of the initial front end design as the entire application didn't need to be loaded at the login page. Using these techniques, we were able to decrease the key metrics from around forty seconds to about five seconds. More improvements could be made on the performance side but the initial design of the application would have to change. As for the PWA metrics, eleven out of twelve of the tests were passed. The EC2 instance which hosts the application is in the process of being converted to HTTPS by the service administrator which would pass the final test upon completion.
